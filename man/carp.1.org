* NAME
carp - EncFS CLI managing tool

* SYNOPSIS

*carp* [ *-c* path ] *create* [ *-m* ] [ *-s* ] /rootdir/

*carp* [ *-c* path ] [ *mount* | *umount* ] [ *-t* ] [ *-n* ] /name/

*carp* [ *-c* path ] [ *pull* | *push* ] [ *-t* ] /name/

*carp* [ *-c* path ] *list* [ *mounted* | *unmounted* | *all* ]

*carp* [--help]

* DESCRIPTION

carp is an EncFS frontend to ease day-to-day creating, mounting and
umounting your various stashes. Using this script, your stash will
always be mounted under /~/Private/.

* COMMANDS

 - create :: Create a new EncFS stash.
 - mount :: Mount an existing EncFS stash.
 - umount :: Umount a currently mounted EncFS stash.
 - pull :: Pull a distant stash.
 - push :: Push to a distant stash.
 - list :: List all your currently mounted EncFS stashes.

* OPTIONS

 - -c :: Alternate path to a config file.
 - --help :: Show an help message. All commands have their own help
      pages, accessible through *carp command --help*. For exemple:
      *carp create --help*

** CREATE OPTIONS

 - -m :: Automount your new encfs folder after creation.
 - -s :: Save your password in your home folder to avoid typing it when
      mounting your secret folder.
 - /rootdir/ :: The path to your future encrypted stash. This path MUST
      be a complete path, not a relative one.

** MOUNT, UMOUNT OPTIONS

 - -n :: Ignore sync feature.

** MOUNT, UMOUNT, PULL AND PUSH OPTIONS

 - -t :: Do not actually do the action asked. For *pull* and *push* it
      will lead to a dry-run of rsync. For *mount* and *umount* it will
      only check if the required directories are in place.
 - /name/ :: The name of one of your EncFS stash. You can find these
      names by using the *carp list* command. You can also pass the
      special name *all* to work on all relevant stashes (mounted
      stashes for the umount all command or unmounted stashes for the
      mount all, pull all or push all).

* FILES

~/.config/.carp/carp.conf - Default config file (if *-c* option is not
provided). It will be created if it does not exists. Only stash listed
in there are taken into account.

~/.config/.carp/* - Each subfolder contains the stash-related
configuration file and your encrypted passphrase if you chose to save
it.

~/Private - All your EncFS stash will be mounted under the /Private/
folder of the current user home folder.
